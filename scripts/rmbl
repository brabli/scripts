# ReMove Broken Links

find $LOCAL_BIN -type l ! -exec test -e {} \; -exec rm -fv {} \;

# Here's what the command does:

# find: This command is used to search for files and directories within a specified path.
# /path/to/directory: Replace this part with the actual path of the directory where you want to remove broken symlinks.
# -type l: This tells find to look for symbolic links.
# ! -exec test -e {} \;: This part checks if the symlink points to an existing file or directory. The test -e command checks if the file exists, and the ! before it negates the result, so it matches broken symlinks.
# -exec rm -fv {} \;: This part executes the rm command to remove the broken symlink found. The {} \; is a placeholder for the file name found by find, and -fv options for rm mean "force" (to avoid confirmation prompts) and "verbose" (to show which files are being deleted).
